Maths of how to extract SIRE parameters from speech 
Applied to one gesture only on NAO - moving from base position to arms extended back to base position. Looked at affect of voice only, motion only and voice + motion (voice was original human recorded input)
- showed that motion alone was able to confer the same emotion that had been in the original input speech (lower recognition rate than voice alone but significantly better than chance)
- combining original input speech and gestures had mixed results for ease of understanding: much better for happiness, a bit better for sadness, maybe better for fear and much worse for anger (suggest due to neutral stance being more agressive than implemented gesture)},
