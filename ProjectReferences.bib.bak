Maths of how to extract SIRE parameters from speech 
Applied to one gesture only on NAO - moving from base position to arms extended back to base position. Looked at affect of voice only, motion only and voice + motion (voice was original human recorded input)
- showed that motion alone was able to confer the same emotion that had been in the original input speech (lower recognition rate than voice alone but significantly better than chance)
- combining original input speech and gestures had mixed results for ease of understanding: much better for happiness, a bit better for sadness, maybe better for fear and much worse for anger (suggest due to neutral stance being more agressive than implemented gesture)},

Example: disgust scrunching of nose and mouth would reduce airflow and hence intake of noxious gas, however now used to respond to unagreeable behaviour or information. For me - observer ability to decode important for robot emotion work because examples suggest that response is involuntary; for example assigning higher social status to an agent who displays pride. Second example of fear contagion - monkeys never before scared of snakes became scared of snakes when they saw other monkeys who were so. Could this work for positive emotions? i.e. someone who doesn't like a task actually begins to like it after seeing a robot like it (obvious applications in therapy, education etc. and seemingly obvious if you think about parents conving their children to eat their greens by saying how tasty they are etc.)},
